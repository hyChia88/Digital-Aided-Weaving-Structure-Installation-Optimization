## About the Project

This library contains the code for a Label Machine Control App, developed as part of the research project "Digital Aided Installation and Optimization for Weaving Structures". The system automates the labeling of round or rectangular rods (3mmâ€“20mm) with customized codes at specific distances defined by CSV input, significantly improving weaving structure installation efficiency.

## Background: Weaving Structure Installation Challenges

Weaving Structure details can be found in the research paper:

I encountered several challenges during previous installation work, which motivated this research project and the development of an installation aid system.

## Optimization (1): Optimization of the installation sequences 
### (1) Simulate the Installation Process:
Run simulations to track how structures move and change during installation

### (2) Analysis of Sequence & Rod Performance
Compare changes in sequence and displacement to understand the basic rules of the process.

### (3) Generate Installation Guidelines:
Use these rules to create helpful installation sequences for workers.

## Result Improvement
This application supports custom-designed hardware for automatic rod marking, enabling precise, random-position labeling on weaving rods. The system specifically addresses challenges in manual rod marking for bending-active gridshell structures.  

- **Installation Efficiency**: 33% reduced installation time through improved rod labeling process, enhancing overall efficiency for weaving structure fabrication
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved label design with color-coded system for easier rod identification and assembly
