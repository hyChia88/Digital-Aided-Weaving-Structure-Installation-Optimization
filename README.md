## About the Project

This library contains the code for a Label Machine Control App, developed as part of the research project "Digital Aided Installation and Optimization for Weaving Structures". The system automates the labeling of round or rectangular rods (3mmâ€“20mm) with customized codes at specific distances defined by CSV input, significantly improving weaving structure installation efficiency.

## Background

### Weaving Structure Installation Challenges

Weaving Structure details can be found in the research paper:  
> Huang, W., Wu, C., Hu, J., & Gao, W. (2022). [Weaving structure: A bending-active gridshell for freeform fabrication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104184). Automation in Construction, 136, 104184.

I encountered several challenges during previous installation work, which motivated this research project and the development of an installation aid system.

## Project Description

This application supports custom-designed hardware for automatic rod marking, enabling precise, random-position labeling on weaving rods. The system specifically addresses challenges in manual rod marking for bending-active gridshell structures.

### Performance Improvement

- **Installation Efficiency**: 33% reduced installation time through improved rod labeling process, enhancing overall efficiency for weaving structure fabrication
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved label design with color-coded system for easier rod identification and assembly
